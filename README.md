# Test Taker

This is a simple application to choose multiple choice options and see results. This is the first project written after reviewing basic JavaScript, so uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Concepts practiced/learned:

- JS objects, constructors, arrays, DOM navigation (parent nodes, previous child element), click event listeners, resetting a table to initial state by storing innerHTML value, array filter method
- Switching between states is annoying with all the display none to display block switches
- I need more practice with CSS layouts
- For next project, I should look to incorporate async and fetch API, and learn JS testing
